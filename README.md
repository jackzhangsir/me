## Welcome to [Wu Sheng 吴晟](https://github.com/wu-sheng) GitHub Pages

First of all, I am an open source lover. Contribute for different open source projects in these years. And want to continue my contributions. ^_^

Right now, I am a **Principle Engineer** in 2012 Labs, [Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.](http://www.huawei.com)

In open source world, I am Apache SkyWalking project creator, PPMC member and committer. At the same time, I am a member of Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) OpenTracing Specification Council, for representing SkyWalking project.

My work revolves around distributed systems, distributed tracer, APM, and runtime code generation/manipulation tech. My primary goal is to build an apm/tracer tool, with _High Efficient_, _Professional_, _for distributed-cluster or cloud_, and also **easy** to use. In particular, interested in how to build and diagnose large scale systems.
