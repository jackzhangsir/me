## Welcome to [wusheng 吴晟](https://github.com/wu-sheng) GitHub Pages

I am a **Principle Engineer** in 2012 Labs, [Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.](http://www.huawei.com).

My work revolves around distributed systems, distributed tracer, APM, and runtime code generation/manipulation tech. My primary goal is to build an apm/tracer tool, with _High Efficient_, _Professional_, _for distributed-cluster or cloud_, and also **easy** to use. In particular, interested in how to build and diagnose large scale systems.
